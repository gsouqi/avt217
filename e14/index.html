    <p>First open XD</p>
    <p>Create a custom file that is 1000 px wide and 1000 px height</p>

    <p>And place the rectangle you just created at the bottom of the file and change the color to #0F29DD</p>
    <p>Now create a triangle that is 443 width and 352 height</p>
    <p>Change the color to #FF0000 and place the triangle at the center then slightly offset to the left</p>
    <p>Create another triangle with the size 409 x 395 and the color #AD2349</p>
    <p>Place the triangle that you just created at the same position and drag it lower than the first triangle</p>
    <p>Now create a rectangle with the size 95 x 454 and the fill color stays the same</p>
    <p>Place the rectangle on top of the first rectangle and place it to the right</p>
